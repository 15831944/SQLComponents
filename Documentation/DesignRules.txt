DESIGN RULES FOR SQLCOMPONENTS
==============================

1) Alle components are within the "SQLComponents" namespace.
2) All throws are of type "CString". So calling programs **MUST**
   rely on a try...catch cycle that catches "CString" objects
3) There are two modes of operandi
   SQL_COMPONENTS_MFC  -> All CStrings are MFC objects
   No definition       -> All CStrings are ATL objects
   The library and program must be compiled alike!
4) Everything must work in both 32-bits and 64-bits modes
5) Platform of choice is MSVC 2017, C++17.0 standard
6) Coding-guidelines are:
   - 1 tab = 2 spaces
   - Hungarian camelcase naming rules
   - class members have the "m_" prefix
   - method parameters have the "p_" prefix
7) All ODBC driver datatypes are covered by SQLVariant natively
8) All ODBC binary data is covered by m_data of SQLVariant
