======================================

Version 1.6.0 of 22-06-2019
---------------------------
1) Added the SQLOperator enumerator for the SQLFilters
2) Added the SQLFunction enumerator for the SQLFilters
3) Expanded SQLFilters to work with a maximum of 1 SQLFunction
   Working filters for SQL Select statements in the SQLDataSet are:
   - fieldname <operator> <value>
   - FUNCTION(fieldname) <operator> <value>
   - fieldname <operator> <unary FUNCTION>
   Functions can have zero, one, two or three arguments.
   All values need to be added to the filter in that order, the 
   <value> to operate on as last.
   See: "Filtertest.cpp" for a number of examples.
   All ODBC 3.52 functions can be used for a condition filter
4) Added unit tests for all function-filter combinations
