RELEASENOTES SQLCOMPONENTS VERSION 1.5
======================================
====== Released since:28-05-2018 =====
======================================

Version 1.5.3 of 29-11-2018
---------------------------
1) Various small code corrections from CPPCheck 1.85
2) Upgrade to Firebird 3.0.4 Server

Version 1.5.2 of 17-09-2018
---------------------------
1) Added two new members to SQLVariant
   - AttachBinary
   - DetachBinary
   Both members are meant to deal with already internal buffers that can be set
   to a SQLVariant in order to store them as a BLOB (Binary Large OBject)
2) Fixed a bug in re-loading a SQLDataSet from an XML file.

Version 1.5.1 of 07-08-2018
---------------------------
1) New SQLFilter extensions for CXHibernate
2) DDLCreateTable now creates a number of independent scripts so that they can be
   run in succession against a database to (re-)create the objects
3) A small optimalisation in the SQLDataset in UPDATE'ing individual records
4) Re-Throw of a safe exception in exception handlers
5) Code quality checks from SonarQube
6) StringInitCapital and StringStartCapital now deal wiht initial diacritic characters.

Version 1.5.0 of 28-05-2018
---------------------------
1) The new compile time macro "COMPILED_TOGETHER_WITH_MARLIN" makes it possible to 
   drop the library in a larger project, together with the Marlin library at once.
   Just copy the directory, plugin the "SQLComponents.vcxproj" file in your solution,
   and set this macro on the project definition as an extra C++ macro define.

2) The datatype "long" in SQLVariant has been replaces by the standard "int" type.
   This works better together with different other projects and libraries.

3) The SQLFilter and SQLFilter set has been rewritten to have local copies off all values

4) The CreateTable file can now be locally configured with model parts and then generate
   the desired DDL for creating a table, before the table even exists in the database

5) Small rewrites to the SQLDataSet, so that the "Insert" functionallity can use a 
   sequence generator

6) All throws of CString has been refactored to throws of "StdException"
