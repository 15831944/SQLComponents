RELEASENOTES SQLCOMPONENTS VERSION 1.5
======================================
====== Released since:28-05-2017 =====
======================================

1) The new compile time macro "COMPILED_TOGETHER_WITH_MARLIN" makes it possible to 
   drop the library in a larger project, together with the Marlin library at once.
   Just copy the directory, plugin the "SQLComponents.vcxproj" file in your solution,
   and set this macro on the project definition as an extra C++ macro define.

2) The datatype "long" in SQLVariant has been replaces by the standard "int" type.
   This works better together with different other projects and libraries.

3) The SQLFilter and SQLFilter set has been rewritten to have local copies off all values

4) The CreateTable file can now be locally configured with model parts and then generate
   the desired DDL for creating a table, before the table even exists in the database

5) Small rewrites to the SQLDataSet, so that the "Insert" functionallity can use a 
   sequence generator

6) All throws of CString has been refactored to throws of "StdException"
